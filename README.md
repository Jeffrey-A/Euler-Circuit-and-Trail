# EulerCircuitTrail
Given a graph (vertices and edges) the program calculates the degree of each vertex and indicates if the given graph has a Euler circuit or trail or neither. 
if you want to run it, first what the video "wactchMe.mp4" so that you know how to input data. Then run main.py to interact with the program.
